In addition to TAing math courses, I am an instructor for Cornell's [College of Outdoor Education](https://scl.cornell.edu/coe/pe-courses), where I've taught cross-country skiing, rock climbing, and ice climbing. I was also an AI at [MathILy-Er](https://mathily.org/mathilyer/) in 2022 and 2023, where I taught IBL courses on computability theory, the mathematics of juggling, and an assortment of other topics.
